# Zill Library

The Zill Web UI Library (formerly known as XUI) was born out of the need to standarize common UI elements to build web-based tools. Elements such as windows, buttons, dialogs, dropdowns, context menus and more.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add zill
```

## Elements

The [ELEMENTS.md](./docs/ELEMENTS.md) file in the [docs](./docs/) folder contains all the currently available XUI elements and their respective documentation.

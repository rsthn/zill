# XUI 2

The XUI toolkit was born because we like very much to create web-based tools, and we often found the need to have a standard way to define common UI elements to speed up our development process.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @rsthn/xui
```

## Elements

The [ELEMENTS.md](./docs/ELEMENTS.md) file in the [docs](./docs/) folder contains all the currently available XUI elements and their respective documentation.
